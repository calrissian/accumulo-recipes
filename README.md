#What are Accumulo Recipes?

These recipes and stores have been created as a starting point for using Accumulo to implement various different use-cases. The projects contained in this repository could be used either directly or modified entirely to fit differing needs. The code is meant to provide different scenarios and exemplify:

- How effective Accumulo can be at munging data in parallel across a cluster of machines. 
- How great Accumulo can index and process data using lexicographically sorted keys making that data immediately available.
- How well Accumulo is integrated into the Hadoop stack where data partitioning across the cluster can be fine-tuned to take advantage of locality when doing bulk operations.
