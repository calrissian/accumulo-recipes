#What are Accumulo Recipes?

These recipes and stores have been created as a starting point for using Accumulo to implement various different use-cases. The projects contained in this repository could be used either directly or modified entirely to fit differing needs. The code is meant to provide different scenarios and exemplify:

- How effective Accumulo can be at munging data in parallel across a cluster of machines 
- How great it can index and process data making it immediately available. 
- How Accumulo is integrated well into the Hadoop stack where data partitioning can be fine-tune to take advantage of locality when doing bulk operations.
