# Changelog Store

## What is the Changelog Store?

Many multi-datacenter systems today have to make trade-offs on how they handle their data. Which data needs to be kept synchronized across the systems? Which data should be local to the systems? Many times, it's possible the datacenters themselves may not be connected all the time. When they are, it's very possible they have very little bandwidth by which to communicate. Problems like this make it important to summarize changes between the systems so that as little as possible can be communicated back and forth for the systems to determine which data actually needs to be synchronized.

Merkle Trees work very well for summarizing changes between distributed systems. Git, ZFS, and many peer-to-peer network protocols use it for this very reason. Merkle trees work by breaking up the larger set of data into smaller buckets and then summarizing those buckets, further working up the tree summarizing the parents of the buckets until the root of the tree is summarized. The best-case scenario for this distributed structure is when two systems contain the same data and only the root of the tree was used for that determination. You can read more about Merkle trees [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_tree). 

Calrissian provides a MerkleTree implementation in our commons repo, Mango. We call it [mango-hash](https://github.com/calrissian/mango/tree/master/mango-core/src/main/java/org/calrissian/mango/hash/tree).

## How to store and model changes

The Changelog effectively allows state to be summarized quickly so that the state can be compared against another system running another Changelog store where differences may need to be reconciled quickly. Just like many of the other stores in the Accumulo recipes, we have used the StoreEntry object to model our changes.

###The model

Take for a moment, an update that occurs on a system. Let's say a person's location was updated. We won't get into the specifics about how a person is modeled because that's outside of the scope of this recipe. Instead, let's dive into how I may model a person's location being changed:

```java
StoreEntry changeEvent = new StoreEntry(UUID.randomUUID().toString(), System.currentTimeMillis());
changeEvent.put(new Tuple("id", "person#1"));
changeEvent.put(new Tuple("location", "Virginia"));
```

As it appears, a person with id 1 had their location updated to Virginia.

###Storing changes

First we need to make a couple considerations about the systems we are working with. How often are changes expected to occur? If a system goes down for some reason, could it be down for days or would it come back up in a couple of minutes? These questions will help you determine the bucket size for which to partition your results. The store will default to a bucket size of 5 minutes so we'll use that for our example.

Perhaps it's time to create a store and put some changes in it

```java
Instance instance = new MockInstance();
Connector connector = instance.getConnector("root", "password".getBytes());
AccumuloChangelogStore store = new AccumuloChangelogStore(connector);

store.put(Collections.singletonList(changeEvent));
```
