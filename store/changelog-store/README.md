# Changelog Store

## What is the Changelog Store?

It's easy to use Accumulo to manage changes that may need to be shared & further recitifed on foreign clouds. Since Accumulo gives us the ability to reverse-sort objects by their timestamps, we can create buckets and manage changes in those buckets. Time-based buckets? That sounds like a wonderful changelog problem for a Merkle Tree to optimize.
