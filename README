#What are Accumulo Recipes?

These recipes and stores have been created as a starting point for using Accumulo to implement various different use-cases. The projects contained in this repository could be used either directly or modified entirely to fit differing needs. The code is meant to provide different scenarios and example for how effective Accumulo can be at munging data in parallel across a cluster of machines and how great it can index and process data making it immediately available.
